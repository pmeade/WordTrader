## Introduction

WordTrader is designed to be a light-hearted, whimsical game where players engage in word challenges and humorous interactions. The game leverages blockchain mechanics for virtual NFT trading, adding an extra layer of intrigue and strategy.

## Gameplay

### Ghost Game

In the Ghost game mode, players take turns adding letters to build a word. The current word being built is displayed in the center, with each player's contribution shown in their respective widgets. On their turn, players can add a letter from their inventory or bluff by adding any letter. Players can challenge each other to validate the word being built, adding a strategic element to the game.

### Pineapple Express

Another exciting mode is Pineapple Express, where players collaboratively create entertaining stories using randomly assigned words. This mode encourages creativity and humor as players try to outwit each other with inventive uses of their assigned words.

## Core Features

- **Decentralized Consensus**: Players vote on game proposals using virtual tokens, influencing the game's development.
- **Virtual NFT Trading**: Engage in trading virtual assets without real-world financial risks.
- **Open-Source and Donation-Based**: The game is open-source, with server maintenance funded through Ethereum donations. Donators receive ERC20 tokens in return, which are used to participate in the DAO controlling the game.
- **Player Inventory**: Players have a personal inventory of word tiles, which they use to contribute to the game.
